# Biomimetic-Design-of-EECD-Method-for-Challenging-Water-Scenes

## Description
Considering that change detection models have to deal with some challenges in water scenes, we generate various simulated multi-challenge sequences, 
including Basic, Dynamic Background, Illumination Variations. Note: Each specific sequence is also affected by other challenges, but one challenge is dominant.
This synthetic dataset is a photo-realistic vision laboratory that validates the performance of different methods.

## The overall framework of the proposed EECD method

## Download
The WSCD is a water-scene dataset designed to design and evaluate a variety of computer vision models for change detection.
We provide one [.rar] archive per type of data as described below. Our indexes always start from 000001. In the following,

WSCD_dataset_rbg_2021: Each area is simply a folder in the format: The compressed file contains the original image.

WSCD_dataset_gt_2021: The compressed file contains the ground truth of object detection. The per-pixel segmentation ground truth is encoded as per-frame .png files (standard 8-bit precision per channel).
